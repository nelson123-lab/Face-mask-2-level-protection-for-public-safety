The "mask_alert_model_training" is used to train the model using google collab. The dataset used is same for both the models. The dataset contains 1980x1920 images.

Model "face_mask_detection_alert_system.h5" is generated after training. It is then loaded using "face_mask_project" where we can get the model detect the mask detected or not. If not, trigger mail will be send as email.
